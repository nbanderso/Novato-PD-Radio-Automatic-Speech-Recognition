Project: Novato Police Radio -> Structured Data (Public Safety Transparency Period)

<br>

**1.**     **Purpose & Intent**

This project aims to transform publicly available police radio communications from the Novato, California Police Department into structured, anonymized data for research, transparency, and community insight.

This project is **NOT** intended to:
- Interfere with law enforcement operations
- Identify, shame, or target individuals
- Promote vigilantism, harassment, or defamation
- Track private citizens or release personal data

This project **IS** intended to:
- Study public safety activity trends across Novato, California
- Identify patterns (e.g. location-based activity, response types, temporal trends)
- Explore potential disparities or bias in policing using data, cautiously and responsibly
- Encourage transparent, community-centered discussions about public safety

<br>

**2.**     **Legal Compliance**

This project follows state and federal laws regulating the reception and use of public radio communications:
- Only monitors unencrypted public broadcasts
- Does NOT attempt to decrypt or bypass encrypted systems (illegal under federal law)
- California law allows receiving police radio if:
  - It is not used for committing a crime
  - It is not used to interfere with responders
  - It is not broadcasting a way that places officers or civilians at risk
  - Follows FCC rules (§605 & §705, Communications Act; 47 CFR §90.425)

<br>

**3.**     **Privacy & Redaction Policy**

Although radio transmissions are public, the people involved are still private citizens.  To protect them:

| Information Type | Policy |
| --- | --- |
| Full names, license plates, phone numbers, DOB’s | REDACTED – not stored in published data |
| Exact home address | REDACTED – reduced to street name or block level (e.g. “100 block of Grant Ave”) |
| Audio Recordings | Stored locally for processing only;Not publicly released unless redacted |
| Aggregated statistical data | Safe to publish (e.g. “57 calls near South Novato Blvd in August”) |
| Officer Identities (badges, call signs) | Part of public service role – may remain unless it poses safety risk |

<br>

**4.**     **Acceptable Use of Project Data**

Allowed uses:
- Academic research
- Civic journalism and public transparency
- Data visualization and policy discussions
- Nonprofit and education work

Not allowed:
- Weaponizing data for harassment or doxxing
- Commercial use without attribution
- Identifying private individuals involved in incidents
- Creating systems that predict or profile individuals (“pre-crime” tools)

<br>

**5.**     **Data Accuracy & Limitations**

Police radio data is naturally incomplete, noisy, and main contain misinformation or emotional statements under stress.  Additionally, automated speech-to-text (Whisper AI) and NLP tools may produce errors. 

Therefore:
- **This is not official police documentation**
- **It should not be used for legal decisions, emergency response, or defamation**
- All conclusions must acknowledge uncertainty and potential transcription bias

<br>

**6.**     **Ethical Use of AI**

This project uses Whisper AI and rule-based NLP to transcribe and extract structured insights. 

We acknowledge AI limitations and commit to:
- Regular manual review of samples for accuracy
- Avoiding anthropomorphizing or overstating AI certainty
- Publishing methodology so results can be reproduced and questioned
- Encouraging peer review and academic-style transparency

<br>

**7.**     **Community Accountability**

- Include a CODE\_OF\_CONDUCT.md for contributors
