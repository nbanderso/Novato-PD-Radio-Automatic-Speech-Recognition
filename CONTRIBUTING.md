**Cotributing to Police Radio -> Structured Data**

Thank you for your interest in contributing!  This project is focused on turning public police radio communication into anonymized, structured, and ethical data for research and public transparency.  Contributions of all levels – code, documentation, ideas, or testing – are welcome.

<br>

**How Can you Contribute?**

<br>


**Non-code contributions (no programing required)**
- Reporting bugs or incorrect transcriptions
- Suggesting improvements to street/ten-code lists (gazetteers)
- Helping write documentation or tutorials
- Researching legal or ethics requirements
- Improving README, diagrams, or public explanations

**Code Contributions**
- Audio capture improvements (ffmpeg RTSP)
- Faster-Whisper transcription scripts
- Ten-Code / police jargon expansion logic
- NLP extractions (street names, unit IDs, call types)
- Geocoding (street to lat/lon within Novato boundaries)
- FastAPI UI, mapping, and analytics
